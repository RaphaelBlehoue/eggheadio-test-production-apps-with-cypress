## 1. Course Introduction: Test Production Ready Apps with Cypress

End-to-end testing has a reputation of being flaky and unreliable, with tests
having to be written in such a way that _sleeps_ and waiting are required for
DOM nodes to be evaluated.

Cypress addresses these issues, and more. Cypress is a paradigm shift in in
end-to-end testing.

With Cypress one can test every layer of the stack:

- database
- api
- asynchronous requests
- UI
- frontend stores

Cypress allows this in addition to features such as time travel.
